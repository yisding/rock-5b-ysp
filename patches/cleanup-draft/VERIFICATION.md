The `cleanup-draft/` patches are fixes for the BSP audit findings (`docs/11`),
originally **machine-generated**. Every hunk was put through an **adversarial
review**: independent verifiers read the *real* source (callers, locks,
refcount/fence balance, error paths) and were told to **try to break each fix** —
to find where a "fix" introduces a *new* bug — rather than trust that it compiles.
The cautionary tale: during the audit's own assembly, one fix once
**double-applied a `kref_put`** — a use-after-free that **compiled clean**. "It
builds" is not verification.

The first review found **2 rejects + 1 hold + 3 incomplete fixes** (two of which
compiled clean and would have shipped real regressions), and **5 pre-existing
bugs beyond the audit's findings**. All of them have now been **fixed**, and every
fix was **re-verified** by an independent adversarial pass (refcount/list
arithmetic traced on every path) and a compile-gate. This doc records the final
state.

## Verdict table (after corrections)

| Patch | Verdict | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `mpp_common` | ✅ APPLY | `:250` kzalloc guard **+ the `:1580` `SET_SESSION_FD` companion NULL-guard** (the earlier incompleteness, now closed). |
| `mpp_iommu` | ✅ APPLY **(corrected)** | was a REJECT — the `find_buffer_fd` +1 contract is now honored by **all 3 callers**. **Must apply together with `mpp_rkvenc2.patch`** (see below). |
| `mpp_rkvdec2` | ✅ APPLY | OOB reg-index bounded one consistent way (`RKVDEC_REG_NUM`=360). |
| `mpp_rkvdec2_link` | ✅ APPLY | `:2587` wrong-core fix **+ the `attach_ccu` success-path `pdev` put** (a pre-existing leak, now fixed — see Follow-up fixes). |
| `mpp_rkvenc2` | ✅ APPLY | The `rkvenc_alloc_task` hunk is safe (idempotent free). **Now also carries the `bs_buf` ref-drop — must apply together with `mpp_iommu.patch`.** |
| `mpp_service` | ✅ APPLY **(corrected)** | the `:426` taskqueue-count cleanup was a HOLD (OOB read) — now clamps `taskqueue_cnt=0` before the cleanup goto, so the loop is empty and `class_destroy` still runs. |
| `rga_common` | ✅ APPLY **(corrected)** | `size_cal` `int`→`s64` **+ a `w/h ≤ 65535` upper bound** (closes the residual `s64` overflow the earlier fix left open). |
| `rga_debugger` | ✅ APPLY | `buf[-1]` guard applied uniformly across all four write handlers. |
| `rga_dma_buf` | ✅ APPLY | −58 deletion verified reachability-dead (0 callers). |
| `rga_drv` | ✅ APPLY **(corrected)** | was a partial REJECT (hunk D1) — `rga_ioctl_import_buffer` now has a success-path `goto` so it no longer frees the buffers it just imported. |
| `rga_fence` | ✅ APPLY | seqno lock correct. |
| `rga_iommu` | ✅ APPLY | −33 deletion verified dead; `another_index < 0` fix correct. |
| `rga_job` | ✅ APPLY **(corrected)** | J3 sleep-in-atomic fix correct; J2 fence-balance **+ the `:572` acquire-fence put** (the residual leak, now closed). |
| `rga_mm` | ✅ APPLY | M4+M5+M6 are interdependent — apply together (the patch ships all three). |
| `rga_policy` | ✅ APPLY | `:351` superset test correct. |

**All 15 patches now APPLY** (the rejected one was corrected; `rejected/` is gone).

## Corrections applied (and re-verified SAFE)

| # | Site | Was | Correction | Re-verify |
|---|------|-----|------------|-----------|
| 1 | `rga_drv` `rga_ioctl_import_buffer` | 🛑 REJECT — success path fell into `err_release_buffer:` and freed every just-imported buffer | added `goto err_free_external_buffer;` before the label | SAFE — all 3 error paths + `size==0` traced correct |
| 2 | `mpp_iommu` find-contract | 🛑 REJECT — `find` returns +1 but only 1 of 3 callers updated → 2 leaks | `release_fd` drops the temp ref (2nd `kref_put`); `rkvenc2_task_init` drops it via `mpp_dma_release` | SAFE — net `−1`/`net 0` preserved; `kref_get_unless_zero` ⟹ ref≥2 so the first put can't free; `bs_buf` held by the mem_region import ref; exactly 3 callers, all balanced |
| 3 | `mpp_service:426` | ⏸️ HOLD — cleanup loop ran with an oversized count → OOB read | `srv->taskqueue_cnt = 0;` before the goto | SAFE — loop runs 0×, `class_destroy` still runs, no double-destroy |
| 4 | `mpp_common:1580` | incomplete — `SET_SESSION_FD` `get_task_msgs` unguarded | `if (!msgs) { fdput(f); goto session_switch_done; }` | SAFE — deref closed, `fdput` balanced, post-label can't double-add |
| 5 | `rga_job:572` | incomplete — `acquire_fence` leaked on the `-EFAULT` path | `rga_dma_fence_put(acquire_fence);` before the return | SAFE — all 5 exit paths exclusive, one put each |
| 6 | `rga_common` `size_cal` | incomplete — residual `s64` overflow via `uint32_t` dims | `if (w > 65535 || h > 65535) return -EINVAL;` | SAFE — 65535 == the `uint16` dim max, rejects nothing legitimate |

> **⚠️ `mpp_iommu.patch` + `mpp_rkvenc2.patch` are an ATOMIC PAIR — apply both or
> neither.** The `find_buffer_fd` +1 contract change (mpp_iommu) and the
> `rkvenc2_task_init` ref-drop (mpp_rkvenc2) balance each other. Applying
> `mpp_iommu` alone → a leaked ref per JPEGE task; applying `mpp_rkvenc2` alone →
> a premature ref drop → **UAF/double-free**. (`rga_mm`'s M4+M5+M6 trio is the same
> kind of within-patch interdependency, already shipped together.)

## Verification status

| Method | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Adversarial per-finding review (real source) | ✅ done |
| Corrections re-verified (independent adversarial pass) | ✅ **SAFE** — refcount balance traced on every path |
| Patches apply to fwport HEAD | ✅ all 15 apply clean |
| **Compile-gate** (safe set + the devfreq re-guard, OOT build vs 6.18 headers) | ✅ **PASS** — 0 errors, both modules link |
| **Runtime codec regression** (encode/decode/transcode + targeted triggers) | ⏳ pending — needs a kernel/module rebuild + reboot |

### Runtime gate result — record here when run

⏳ **Not yet run** (as of 2026-07-01). When the gate is executed, replace this
placeholder with: date, kernel version + PHASH, which series was applied
(`cleanup-split/` @ commit), the `tests/` results (encode/decode/transcode),
and the outcome of each targeted trigger (OOB reg-index, `buf[-1]`, non-mpp fd
to `SET_SESSION_FD`, `RELEASE_FD` + re-import, async RGA acquire-fence) — and
update `STATUS.md`.

## Follow-up fixes — pre-existing bugs the audit missed (now fixed, re-verified SAFE)

The verification surfaced 5 bugs **beyond** the audit's 89 findings. All five are
now fixed (folded into the per-file patches) and **re-verified by an independent
adversarial pass** that traced the refcount/list arithmetic on every path:

| Site | Bug → fix | Re-verify |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| `mpp_rkvdec2_link.c:rkvdec2_attach_ccu` | success-path `pdev` leak → `put_device` on success (mirrors rkvenc) | SAFE — 4 mutually-exclusive returns, one put each |
| `mpp_rkvenc2.c:rkvenc_attach_ccu` | `np` leak on the `!available` path → `of_node_put(np)` before the return | SAFE — np put exactly once on every path |
| `mpp_rkvenc2.c:rkvenc_core_probe` | irq-failure leaves `enc` on `ccu->core_list` → `failed:` now detaches it (guarded by `enc->ccu`, set **only** on full attach) | SAFE — `enc->ccu ⟺ listed` invariant airtight; detach exactly inverts attach; right lock, no deadlock; `mpp_iommu_remove` frees no domain → no UAF |
| `mpp_rkvdec2.c` core + default probe | error paths didn't unwind `mpp_dev_probe()` → route through `err_remove`/`mpp_dev_remove` (also balances the `-EPROBE_DEFER` retry) | SAFE — one unwind per path, correct order (free_rcb before remove) |
| `rga_mm.c:rga_mm_set_mmu_base` | uninitialized page-table entries for a missing plane → reject the malformed request before alloc | SAFE — rejects no legitimate NV12/YUV420P request |

The 6th residual — the `mpp_dma_find_buffer_fd` race — was already closed by the
`mpp_iommu` correction. **No open residuals remain from the verification.**

## Known unfixed items (not regressions — intentional / pre-existing)

Two real issues are *known* and deliberately **not** fixed in this draft. Neither
is introduced by the cleanup patches; both are out of scope for the arm64 target
or low enough severity to defer to a v2.

| # | Site | Issue | Why unfixed |
|---|------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | `mpp_iommu.c:553` `mpp_iommu_probe` | `WARN_ON(!mapping)` warns but then still derefs `mapping->domain` → null-deref | **arm32-only** (`#ifdef CONFIG_ARM_DMA_USE_IOMMU`), unreachable on the arm64 RK3588 target. The single "left-unapplied" row in the audit matrix. One-line fix (`return` after the WARN) if arm32 is ever targeted. |
| 2 | `mpp_iommu.c` `mpp_dma_import_fd` (`static_use=1` path) | Re-importing the **same** `static`/`TRANS_FD_TO_IOVA` fd returns `+1`, but the *create* path of a static buffer takes no outside ref — so duplicate static imports over-ref the buffer (it stops being LRU-evictable; the extra refs aren't dropped until session teardown). | **Pre-existing and unchanged** — pre-patch's found path did the same `kref_get_unless_zero`. Low severity, session-bounded. Surfaced by the `mpp_iommu` re-verification. Fixable by dropping `find`'s temp ref on the static found path (matches the create path) — but it's another refcount edit, so it wants the same adversarial re-verification before shipping. |

Beyond these two: the audit was a **sample, not a proof** (3 lenses over the 15
shipped files). The ~98% byte-identical BSP code we carried over very likely has
further latent bugs no lens surfaced. "Two known items left" ≠ "bug-free."

## How to apply the safe set

1. Apply all 15 patches — **but `mpp_iommu.patch` and `mpp_rkvenc2.patch` must go
   together** (atomic pair, above), and `rga_mm.patch` ships its M4+M5+M6 trio
   together.
2. Compile-check (`make ARCH=arm64 drivers/video/rockchip/`).
3. Then the **runtime regression** is the real gate: rebuild, reboot, and re-run
   `tests/` (encode + decode + transcode) plus the targeted triggers from the
   verifier notes (the OOB reg-index, `buf[-1]`, a non-mpp fd to `SET_SESSION_FD`,
   `RELEASE_FD` + re-import, an async RGA acquire-fence).
4. The Residual follow-ups above are optional but worth a v2.
