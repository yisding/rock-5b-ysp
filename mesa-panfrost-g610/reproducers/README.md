# Reproducers

These are the standalone C programs used while debugging Panfrost texture
transfers on ROCK 5B / Mali-G610, plus the archived Mesa patch needed to
rebuild the failing BLIT configuration. They use GBM/EGL and GLES 3.x
directly, so run them on the board with a Mesa build that includes Panfrost.

All GL entrypoints are loaded via `eglGetProcAddress` specifically to bypass
glvnd and guarantee the locally built Mesa driver is exercised.

## Build

```bash
cc -O2 -o repro_blit repro_blit.c -lEGL -lGLESv2 -lgbm -lm
cc -O2 -o probe_interp probe_interp.c -lEGL -lGLESv2 -lgbm -lm
cc -O2 -o probe_wcorr probe_wcorr.c -lEGL -lGLESv2 -lgbm -lm
cc -O2 -o bench_transfer bench_transfer.c -lEGL -lGLESv2 -lgbm -lm
```

If testing a local Mesa build, point the loader at the built DRI target, for
example:

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/mesa/build/src/egl:/path/to/mesa/build/src/gbm:/path/to/mesa/build/src/gallium/targets/dril
export LIBGL_DRIVERS_PATH=/path/to/mesa/build/src/gallium/targets/dril
export GBM_BACKENDS_PATH=/path/to/mesa/build/src/gbm/backends/dri
export EGL_PLATFORM=surfaceless
```

`GBM_BACKENDS_PATH` is required as well as `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`: the build's
`libgbm` otherwise searches only its configured prefix for `dri_gbm.so`
(`MESA-LOADER: failed to open dri: ... (search paths /usr/local/lib/...gbm)`)
and `gbm_create_device()` fails — observed on the board 2026-07-01 when the
previously used `/usr/local` Mesa prefix had been removed.

The programs default to `/dev/dri/renderD128`. `repro_blit.c` and
`bench_transfer.c` also honor:

```bash
REPRO_NODE=/dev/dri/renderD128
```

(`probe_interp.c` and `probe_wcorr.c` hardcode `renderD128`.)

## `0001-panfrost-advertise-transfer-blit-and-compute.patch`

The BLIT-vs-COMPUTE comparison needs a Mesa build whose default transfer path
is the sampled BLIT — a configuration no upstream tree will ship once the MR
lands in any form. This patch is the pristine `git format-patch` export of
local commit `e8cf2ae6daa` ("panfrost: enable blit-based texture transfers",
branch `panfrost-transfer-blit` of `github.com/yisding/mesa`).

- It advertises `PIPE_TEXTURE_TRANSFER_BLIT` **only**; no local commit ever
  advertised `BLIT|COMPUTE`. The COMPUTE side of every comparison was forced
  on the same build with `MESA_COMPUTE_PBO=1`.
- Apply it on top of the shader-image mask fix ("panfrost: clear shader image
  mask on trailing unbinds", `Fixes: 72ff66c3d73`) — local `950d19686d8`, on
  Mesa main `c05334058d5` (2026-06-22). `git apply --check` also passes
  against later 26.2-devel trees that still carry
  `caps->texture_transfer_modes = 0;` (verified 2026-07-01).
- The annotation block between the commit message and the diff (ignored by
  `git am`) records the full provenance and the
  `BIFROST_MESA_DEBUG=shaders` disassembly-capture method behind the asm
  listings in [`../blit-precision.md`](../docs/blit-precision.md).

## `repro_blit.c`

Minimal reproducer for the format-changing integer readback path.

It creates an `RG32UI` texture where `source[i] = {i, i}`, attaches it to an FBO,
then reads it back as `RGBA_INTEGER`/`UNSIGNED_INT`. With the sampled BLIT
transfer path, Mesa stages this through a `u_blitter` TXF shader.

Run:

```bash
./repro_blit 16307
```

Observed BLIT failure on Mali-G610:

```text
W=16307  mismatches=15672 / 16307
i=1024   sampled=1023
i=8192   sampled=8185
i=16306  sampled=16293
```

Expected with COMPUTE or CPU fallback:

```text
mismatches=0/16307
```

## `probe_interp.c`

Interpolation precision probe.

It renders a `W x 1` quad with a varying that runs from `0` to `W` across the
quad and writes the interpolated f32 bit pattern to an integer render target
(`R32UI` read back as `GL_RED_INTEGER` — same-format, so the readback itself
never takes the staging blit and the probe stays valid even on a broken-BLIT
build).

Modes:

```text
0 = smooth/perspective varying
1 = noperspective varying
2 = gl_FragCoord.x
```

Run:

```bash
./probe_interp 16307 0
./probe_interp 16307 2
```

Observed result (re-verified on the ROCK 5B 2026-07-01, Mesa 26.2-devel local
build, kernel 6.18.37-current-rockchip64 #7):

```text
mode=SMOOTH      floor(interp) != i : 15672 / 16307   max_rel_err=5.751e-02
  i=16306 interp=16293.2832 ideal=16306.5 err=-13.2168
mode=FRAGCOORD.x floor(interp) != i : 0 / 16307       max_rel_err=0
```

This isolates the problem to the varying path. `gl_FragCoord.x` is exact.

**Mode 1 (`noperspective`) cannot produce a count**: `noperspective` is a
reserved word in GLSL ES, and the probe compiles its shaders as
`#version 310 es`, so mode 1 fails at shader compile time
(`illegal use of reserved word 'noperspective'` — observed 2026-07-01). The
"noperspective is not exact on Mali" claim in
[`../blit-precision.md`](../docs/blit-precision.md) rests on the Panfrost lowering
(`pan_nir_lower_noperspective.c` routes it through the same perspective
machinery) and on the compiler-level `prefer_persp = false` experiment, not
on this probe.

## `probe_wcorr.c`

Shader-side recovery probe.

This checks whether the fragment shader can recover an exact coordinate using
local information such as derivatives. It could not; the derivative-based
candidate was worse than using the raw varying:

```text
raw floor(tc)!=i        : 15672 / 16307
dFdx reconstruction     : 16187 / 16307
```

The file name is historical. Earlier variants checked whether
`gl_FragCoord.w` carried a useful correction term — it does not:
`gl_FragCoord.w` is exactly `1.0` in this draw, so dividing by it changes
nothing (identical 15672/16307).

## `bench_transfer.c`

Microbenchmark for the same `RG32UI -> RGBA32UI` readback shape.

Comparative mode needs a build that takes the BLIT path by default — i.e. a
tree with
[`0001-panfrost-advertise-transfer-blit-and-compute.patch`](0001-panfrost-advertise-transfer-blit-and-compute.patch)
applied. The default path then selects BLIT while `MESA_COMPUTE_PBO=1` forces
COMPUTE:

```bash
ST_DEBUG=noreadpixcache ./bench_transfer 16307 1 80 10
ST_DEBUG=noreadpixcache MESA_COMPUTE_PBO=1 ./bench_transfer 16307 1 80 10
```

Useful dimensions from the local timing pass:

```bash
./bench_transfer 16307 1
./bench_transfer 16000 1
./bench_transfer 16384 1
./bench_transfer 1024 1024
./bench_transfer 4096 256
```

Recorded medians are in [`../validation.md`](../docs/validation.md).

## `mr42563-comment-failures.txt`

The exact 25 dEQP cases from the MR !42563 review comment that were rerun
locally after switching the MR direction to COMPUTE (result: 24/25 Pass, 1
pre-existing QualityWarning — [`../validation.md`](../docs/validation.md), which
also records the exact dEQP invocation).
